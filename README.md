# Modular Architecture with Navigation and DI 
A project to show how to deal with navigation and DI in a multi-module project.

- To deal with DI, I did two examples using the most famous libraries [koin](../../tree/koin) and [dagger2](../../tree/dagger2).
- To navigate between features, I'm using a library called [SweetFactory](https://github.com/Tulioh/SweetFactory). With this library you can reference an interface from a base module and instantiate a concrete implementation from a feature module.
